# Student Management System Report
## 1. Project Setup
### Set up the development environment

### Start the Django project
In the console, use the following command to start the Django project.
```
django-admin startproject student_management .
```
Note: If there is no dot at the end, Django will create a nested project directory, e.g. `/student_management/student_management`.
Use the following command to run the project.
```
py manage.py runserver
```
The project runs successfully.

### Add the students app

## 2. Create Student Model
### Describe the database schema in models.py
### Create a migration
### Apply the migrations and create databases

## 3. Set up admin interface
### Apply existing migrations
```shell
(venv) D:\24fall-term\GNG5300\Django-projects\student_management>python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, students
Running migrations:
  ...
```
### Add a superuser
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and log in with the credentials to see the following page:

### Register the Student model and customize the list display
In the students folder, find admin.py and register the model using the following code:
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Student

# Register your models here.
class StudentAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('first_name', 'last_name', 'enrollment_date')
    ordering = ('-enrollment_date',)

admin.site.register(Student, StudentAdmin)
```
Now the Student model is visible in the admin page, and it only displays the first name, last name, and enrollment date.

## 4. Views and Templates
I created four view functions for my students app in the `views.py` file in the `students/` directory:
- **students_list( )** will display a list of all students.
- **students_detail( )** will display the detail of one student. 
- **students_add( )** will later show a form to allow users to add a new student.
- **students_edit( )** will later show a form to allow users to update information of an existing student.

```python
# students/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from students.models import Student

'''Display a list of all students'''
def students_list(request):
    students = Student.objects.all().order_by('-enrollment_date')
    context = {
        'students': students,
    }
    return render(request, 'students/list.html', context)

'''Display the details of a single student'''
def students_detail(request, student_id):
    student = Student.objects.get(id=student_id)
    context = {
        'student': student,
    }
    return render(request, 'students/detail.html', context)

'''Add a new student'''
def students_add(request):
    return render(request, 'students/add.html')

'''Edit an existing student'''
def students_edit(request, student_id):
    student = Student.objects.get(id=student_id)
    context = {
        'student': student,
    }
    return render(request, 'students/edit.html', context)
```
### Display a list of all students
### Display the details of a single student.
### Add a new student.
### Edit an existing student’s information.
